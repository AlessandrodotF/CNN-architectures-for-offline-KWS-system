# CNN-architectures-for-offline-KWS-system 
(Project's report for details) 

In this paper we focus on the implementation of an  offline Key Words Spotting (KWS) system, in particular exploring several architectures of the convolutional neural network family we efficiently solve this kind of task obtaining interesting results. This topic is crucial nowadays because in the last decades several speech-related devices are born. In a nutshell they can use an online/offline stream or just a single key word in order to trigger some functionalities. For our purpose we consider a simple CNN, a CNN combined with a Quasi-SVM and an autoencoder with a SVM in the end. All of them are trained and tested with a huge dataset composed by thousands of examples in terms audio tracks, it is organized in 35 classes. Beside the initial question we add a layer of complexity requiring that the total number of parameters remains below an arbitrary threshold (500K). According to this, we can see that the most efficient approach to solve the proposed challenge is based on the "simple" CNN: we are able to reach an accuracy in the classification above 90\% . We also note that the CNN with a Quasi-SVM is an interesting way to approximate the autoencoder-SVM.
